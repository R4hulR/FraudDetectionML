# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. By analyzing various features and patterns in the data, the model can effectively identify potential fraudulent activities.

## Overview

The credit card fraud detection system is developed using Python and leverages popular machine learning libraries. The project follows a structured approach, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The main steps involved are:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics, such as imbalanced data distribution and feature correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and separating input and target variables.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient.
5. **Visualization**: Plotting the confusion matrix to visualize the model's predictions.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a credit card fraud detection dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The dataset consists of credit card transactions, with the target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are utilized in this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
